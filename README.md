# 🌐 Online Market – Cloud-Based Static Web Deployment

## 📌 Project Overview
This project demonstrates the deployment of a **static e-commerce web application** on **Amazon Web Services (AWS)** using **Amazon S3** and **Amazon CloudFront**.  
The main goal is to host a secure, scalable, and globally accessible static website over **HTTPS**, following cloud computing best practices.

The project was developed as part of the **Cloud Computing (Bulut Bilişim)** course and focuses on real-world cloud deployment rather than application development.

---

## 🎯 Project Objectives
- Deploy a static web application on a cloud platform  
- Enable **HTTPS** access for secure communication  
- Use a **cost-effective and free-tier–compatible** AWS architecture  
- Improve performance using **global content delivery (CDN)**  
- Gain hands-on experience with AWS core services
